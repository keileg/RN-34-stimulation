"""
This is the master file for all simulations related to RN-34. The module contains to
parts: 
    1) The class Simulator, which gives the high-level setup of the different stages in
        the simulation. 
    2) The main run script (see bottom of the file), which contains instructions to the
        Simulator object.
        
The detailed simulator setup is given in the module models.

A note on terminology: The code, and the documentation, is inconsistent on the usage of
'fault' and 'fracture'; the former is the geologically meaningful term, while the latter
is standard terminology in simulation development. Please bear with us.
